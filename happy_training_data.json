After a few years in this zone I started to question things more and get curious about things again. I started to focus on those curiosities that popped up in my head more regularly. One example was that I wished I had taken piano lessons when I was a kid and stayed with it because I\u2019d be able to really play the piano now and wouldn\u2019t that be fun? Eventually I bought a full sized keyboard with weighted keys and I contacted a local pianist to take lessons. That was seven years ago. It\u2019s become one of my favorite and more rewarding hobbies and I\u2019ve developed a wonderful friendship with my piano teacher over all these years. Another example is that I started going on hikes at a local state park that\u2019s not too big but has some nice year round hiking trails. Now I plan vacations around beautiful hiking destinations that are usually not expensive to travel to. Guys at work were talking about going to a local rock climbing gym and I\u2019d always wanted to get into that. Fast forward and I\u2019ve been rock climbing weekly for two years now. What I\u2019m getting at is try pulling on some of your own curious threads that you find sneaking into your thoughts more regularly. Not the lonely thoughts but the things that you were interested in when you were younger. Things that you wish you\u2019d have done. It seems to get easier each time I pull on one of those threads to see if I\u2019m truly interested and if it\u2019ll be good for me to continue. Life has become interesting and fun again for me. Good luck to you and stay the course.",

Sometimes it\u2019s fucked up, and we as humans just gotta roll with the punches as they come, and do our best to make the best out of a bad situation.

It took me a while, but I learned how to counter it.\n\nFunnily enough, the answer for me was \"DONT do what you want\". You basically have to \"work\". You have to spend a day(or even just a chunk of hours) doing something like errands. An actual job can work too, but is usually stressful, and that's not what you want. \n\nYou need to do one or more mindless tasks that you'd consider \"productive\" and would normally find tedious and not want to do.\n\n\nIt's weird, but having infinite free time makes free time boring..               \nYou need to interlace your freetime with chores or errands or sometimes work.\n\nSo taking all THIS into consideration, do something you normally wouldn't do.  Mow the lawn and clear the yard. Clean up and organize the garage or shed.  Run/jog around the block, to a food place, eat lunch, then stroll back.               \nWeird shit like that.\n\nDo this, and then later your free time and old hobbies will feel more rewarding.            \nAlso take a shower, eat a good meal, and sleep well.        \nThis can sometimes be all you need to reset.",

But no wonder playing video games isn't hitting the spot, that's so every-other-day if you don't have a new one to treat yourself with!\n\nAs someone who used to celebrate New Year alone on purpose (nothing like starting my year with a hot bubble bath at midnight before deciding if I feel like going out), I hope you can find a way to treat yourself today, or treat today as different in some way, at least.  What makes you feel good?  A long shower?  A good graphic novel?\n\nI also find it really hard to be sad and eat ice cream at the same time, so maybe a quick jaunt out for a treat for yourself might lighten your mood.  Not sure how introverted you are, but I never had trouble going out to eat or to a movie alone.  Give it a try if everyone else is busy (Monday birthdays are lonelier than most).  If money is tight (as it is for most right now), you could see if your game system is offering any free games for something new, or maybe go for a walk or hike (bring your dog if you have one who can handle it), or goof off with a hobby you've always enjoyed but don't make enough time for.\n\nI also, personally, love to reflect on myself on my birthday.  What did I do right this past year?  What do I want from the coming year?  How can I implement positive change?  Are there relationships that need evaluating, adjusting, or to be dumped, or nurtured better?  Should I add anything to my Bucket List?  Is there anything on my Bucket List I can do and check off?\n\nWhatever your day holds, I hope that if you find yourself swimming in negative emotions, you'll get up and out and try to reset.  You deserve better.  This is a day to celebrate being alive, a day to be grateful for your life.  Do something that makes you feel present, whatever that might be.\n\nAnd if you're super bored and don't know what to do, and you have a caring parent who you can chat with openly, maybe ask them to tell you about the day you were born.  As for me, the doctors forgot my dad was still in the waiting room, without word of my birth for over 4 hours, as he feared the worst!  I'm glad you're not having that day!\n\nAgain, happy birthday stranger, from a stranger who wishes you well!\n\nEdit: I see you posted this 16 hrs ago \ud83d\ude2c... but I still hope you had a better day once some well-wishes came your way!",

It\u2019ll be a happy surprise when people celebrate you but don\u2019t ever expect it. Here\u2019s a stupid story.\n\nThis sounds horrible but it\u2019s ok to get used to it. My parents stopped celebrating my birthday at 16. My parents gave me $100 & dropped me off 4 hours away in a town I was fond of. Then ghosted me for over a week, I hitchhiked home. \n\nStrangers saw me walking down the street & I told them it was my birthday. They invited me to a party at their house. When I showed up they brought out a cake & had invited about a hundred people to sing the song & encourage a good time.\n\nNow if I want to celebrate, I\u2019ll go to my favorite bar & celebrate myself. Usually everyone joins in because it\u2019s an excuse to party. I don\u2019t live a particularly healthy lifestyle but that\u2019s been my solution for the last 10 years to avoid feeling lonely.",

Maybe at an animal shelter, an animal sanctuary, or helping the homeless. I never did anything really hard, I always find it meaningful and enriching.\n\nAlso, if you'd rather avoid references to Christmas, consider eating at Asian restaurants, Indian (Saravanaa Bhavan is excellent, there are two locations in Manhattan), Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese or Japanese restaurants. \n\nArt museums and galleries are places I can thoroughly enjoy alone.",

I got to Vegas late that night with $1075 in American Airlines vouchers. Vegas was cold and I lost twice in poker so I was like eh fuck this, Im out of here. I used all my vouchers and flew to Cozumel, Mexico and had the most amazing time of my life. I just rode my scooter up and down the coast, wind in my hair, smell of salt in the air, 88 degrees all the time, amazing people, $3 meals, every day was taco Tuesday.

We\u2019re family friends with the owners and she had been there chatting with them while she was waiting for her food and order some drinks as well. My sister and brother got positive for Covid when they went in for the test the day of the roll call (which is 2 days after I saw them). They hadn\u2019t been anywhere else since other than grocery shopping (masks and hand sanitizer), they went to the restaurant I think like 4-5 days prior to me coming back home.\n\nIt\u2019s just so bizarre that I didn\u2019t get it, but I also think that it would\u2019ve been nearly impossible for them to get Covid 2 days after seeing me.

He might not have believed it at first possibly because of 1) a lack of self confidence, or 2) not used to women being direct like that, or 3) maybe he\u2019s been burned before and is initially leery when things like that happen. Quite a few women I met when I was younger played coy, hard to get, or not interested for whatever reason. I don\u2019t play those games. I am a fairly direct person when it comes to that. Of course, back then, I was a lot more shy than I am now. When you showed interest in him and asked him, that most likely really made his day when he realized you were being honest and sincere. You probably gave him a big smile and put a little pep in his step.",

So \"comment \u00e7a va\" can be used for either someone you use \"vous\" or \"tu\" for. \"Comment allez-vous\" definitely also works -- it's more formal, and less commonly used, but does work! And the equivalent for \"tu\" is \"comment vas-tu\". Let me know if any of that makes no sense (or if you have any other questions) and I can try to explain another way!",

The way I see it, cultural appropriation happens when someone uses an idea/tradition/etc., from someone else's culture and attempts to benefit from it or take credit for it in a way that is disrespectful to the existing history.\n\nAs an example, there are a number of restaurants with Asian cuisines in the US, founded and run by non-Asians with butchered or fake dishes but nonetheless marketed as authentic Asian food. I think it's fair to accuse those of appropriation because not only are they doing the culture a disservice with poor imitation, they are profiting on it too. On the other hand, if I am a fan of Thai food and make a traditional dish at home, it's not really appropriation because I'm not profiting from it and I'm not lying about where it comes from.\n\nIt's important to understand that this isn't about adopting or being honestly ignorant about the cultural origin, but rather being intentionally exploitive and insensitive. \n\nRemember that people from those cultures may take great pride in their traditions. It is a very special thing for them to wear traditional clothing, or prepare a traditional dish, or practice a martial art passed down to them through generations and proudly show who they are and where they come from. To see someone else parade around in it can be very upsetting. It is so very easy for cultures to be misrepresented, commercialized, robbed of all meaning, and ultimately forgotten. Protecting it can feel very important and personal to people of that culture.\n\nAll of this is my interpretation, and I don't claim it to be a perfect explanation for every scenario. Others may have different feelings or understandings.",

    "text": "It's a great question with no clear answer, but here is how I interpret the line between appreciation and appropriation.\n\nAppreciation is like going to someone's house and seeing a lovely dress that they have, and borrowing it from them with their permission to wear to a party.\n\nAppropriation is akin to borrowing that same dress, but then thinking that you like the pattern but the cut isn't really quite your style, and cutting it up and re-designing the fabric.\n\nTo appreciate is to borrow an aspect from a person's culture, and to use it as it is, and to not disrespect the owner by defacing their belongings. However, you must be reasonable, you could borrow a dress but you wouldn't borrow something personal like underwear, right? \n\nAn example is that perhaps you would like to use a traditional Chinese motif in a shirt design. You would be highly advised against making a modernised version of it, as you would not deface someone's belongings. Or if you wanted to make some qipao silhoutte lingerie, the same would apply. You also wouldn't want to borrow something extremely personal, like a Native American headdress, which is something sacred, as it would be like asking someone if you could borrow their wedding ring for a night out. \n\nThat's just my opinion, though, but I hope it is helpful to you!:)",

The problem isn't that you're trying to appreciate the culture, the problem is that the people whose culture it is are still punished for expressing it, but you're not. \n\nAnother example, when xtians have passover seders. I'm jewish, and I find that extremely offensive, because passover is a holiday about my people's history, so it's very specific to us. They cant just take our history and say it's about them. If they want to appreciate our culture, they're welcome to make latkes or hamentaschen or something, be my guest.

    "text": ">I'm ethnic and I enjoy when anyone wants to participate in my culture and I think the majority of people from whatever country feel the same. Personally I think the term cultural appropriation is stupid.\n\nI will admit that sometimes people online take it way too far and assume white people doing anything with an origin from another culture = cultural appropration. But this isn't what cultural appropriation is at all.\n\nLike no real substantial amount of people are crying \"cultural appropriation\" when a white person makes sushi or enjoys rap music. There is absolutely a distinction between appropriation and appreciation.\n\nThe best way I can describe it, is when a person from one race takes an often looked down upon cultural aspect of another race, and turns it into a trendy little thing for themselves without any awareness for the cultural context surrounding that thing. And largely not having to face the same repercussions.\n\nFor example with cornrows - even today a LOT of people look down on this and view this hairstyle as \"uprofessional\" or low class. There are real black folks out there with hairstyles like cornrows who are either missing out on job opportunities, or being forced to change their hair just to be acceptable for employment. So it comes off as incredibly tone deaf to many people when random rich white celebrities are just getting cornrows for funsies for a week, while not having to deal with any of the same issues that black folks face when they have this hairstyle. Basically a double standard.\n\nI also think a lot of people on the *other* side have way overblown counter-reaction to \"cultural appropriation.\" It's not the worst thing in the world and I don't think most people think it is despite what critics might pretend. But it still is tone deaf and worth calling out.",

It was full of people eating, talking, and laughing. But I felt uneasy. Like I didn't belong there. Suddenly, I realized Bourdain was sitting to my right. After a few moments, he seemed to notice my discomfort and he leaned over and said to me \"Hey, you're not going to end up like me.\" And I woke up...\n\nI've always kinda felt I'd eventually attempt suicide again and succeed.

Tony spent 25 years or so being a chef at high-end restaurants in New York City and describes in detail every aspect, every nuance of that life as only Tony can. He writes about employees doing lines of coke before the evening rush and fucking each other on flour sacks in the dry storage room. He writes about how he wakes up at 5:30 am and then lays in bed in the darkness smoking the day\u2019s first cigarette while mentally making lists of the ingredients and fresh produce he needs to order for the restaurant, the specials he can put on the menu to use up the leftover ingredients he has so that they don\u2019t go to waste. \n\nTony didn\u2019t just *work at a restaurant*. Tony didn\u2019t just *have a job as a chef*. Tony WAS a chef.

Just grass and bushes. If you step on it you will sink up to your neck. Its cool but quite creepy. Its so quiet.\n\nI am happy to hear your house didn't burn down. That's a relief. Power lines coming down is quite scary.  So the fires are necessary but hard to control. I see.\n\nWow. You have bears and mountain lions wandering around? The most interesting animals we get are cows and sheep. It sounds cool but I imagine looking out of your window and seeing a fucking Bobcat staring at you is terrifying.",

Small, local\nbreweries are common here. Ancient ruins etc would be great to have\nsuch easy access to. Our area was part of the 1849 Gold Rush and there\nare lots of foundations and water ditches from that era. There are also\nquite a few native village sites around and finding arrow heads is not \nuncommon. There is a lot of open space near us, a national\nrecreation area and lots of public land with trails and bike paths.\n  Bobcats, no problem, bears with cubs are to be avoided.

She was hammered and slept on the way back.

It was a powerful enough statement to make me think \u201cWow, I unintentionally did really well today\u201d.\n\nAnyway. We broke up a month after that.

    "text": "Mind if I share a story? \n\nThere was a girl that was once my best friend ever. Her name is Hayley. We fell in love when I was 19 and she was 16. Yes, laws and stuff made it challenging but our parents were supportive. However, maturity issues arose. I was a surprisingly mature 19-20 year old (I think) in college, and she was\u2026 well\u2026 in that mid high school phase of still figuring the whole maturity thing out. I had a lot of freedom with my folks, I could leave and do pretty much whatever I wanted as long as I didn\u2019t kill anyone, get killed, or get arrested. And it was not a challenge to remain within those parameters, fortunately. Hayley was raised by a single father and was born when he was only 15. He was tough on her, had very strict curfews, etc etc. she would often get upset when I was able to stay out late on the weekends, partying with friends and whatnot often saying \u201cI wish you would just go home and talk to me on the phone instead.\u201d After half a year of this, we ended up mutually ending our relationship. She dated a couple other guys in the following years and we fell out of touch. \n\nFast forward two years: I just joined the military. I what is called DEP (forget what it stands for) and was essentially living it up and preparing myself before the day I was to go to basic training. 6 months before that day, she reached out to me and suggested we go get a cup of coffee. This was also one of our favorite things to do. After that, we ended up driving around town and talking for several hours. We were falling in love all over again. The issue was me leaving for the military soon. She made it very clear that it would be too difficult for her to be in a relationship with someone so far away. I tried and tried to convince her to give it a chance but ultimately failed. But we stayed exceptionally close. We often talked on the phone, texted, and always spent a ton of time together when I was able to come back home on leave. We would go on weekend trips, get a hotel, get nice dinners, go to bars. It was always a blast and we always knew those feelings were there, but managed them. \n\nOver 5 years of this, she would find boyfriends and we would fall out of touch, obviously. I always had the hope that she would come around or maybe still be single when I got out of the military. \n\nThis leads to me the drunk-related part of the story you inspired me to tell.\n\nNew Years of 2019-2020 I went home on leave. She was single at the time and she texted me saying \u201cWelp, my friend really wants to go to the strip club tonight for whatever reason and wants me to go with her. Should be interesting.\u201d I said \u201cWanna know something funny, I\u2019ve never been to a strip club once in my life.\u201d So she suggested I go with them and so I did. It was fun! And interesting being at a strip club as the only guy in a group of girls. They were trying to buy me lap dances and stuff but I stuck mostly to the bar. I had a few beers and Hayley was having a blast. She was always good at handling her liquor and never got too sloppy, tonight was no different. She was a pleasant drunk. Never had to worry too much about her and her personality really shines when she got to that sweet spot.\n\nI drove her back to her friends house at the end of the night. She was sitting in my passenger seat of my truck and we talked a bit and laughed, but then it got quiet for a minute or two. I noticed she had tears in her eyes. She looked at me and said \u201cDallas, maybe I\u2019m just drunk right now, but what I\u2019m about to say definitely isn\u2019t drunk nonsense. I think it\u2019s just giving me the courage to say it. I love you so much. You are the world to me. You are the only guy who has ever truly understood me, loved me for exactly who I am, and you\u2019ve always been there for me no matter what. I\u2019m so stupid. Why can\u2019t I just be with you??? I\u2019ve wasted so much time on these guys looking for the one when you\u2019ve been right here in front of me all along.\u201d\n\nTo keep the story from getting too long, I ended up flying out again a couple days later and we still avoided a long distance relationship. We talked about how I only had a year 1/2 left in my contract and that when I\u2019m finally back home for good, we will make things work. \n\nSkip ahead another year. I haven\u2019t talked to Hayley in a year now. And Hayley is married. Yeah, it\u2019s sad. But I\u2019m happy for her. This guy had to have been something special to win her over. And from the looks of it, she\u2019s happy and he\u2019s a great guy. \n\nSo if you made to this point, thanks for reading! But I often think back to that night and what she told me. I remember my heart filling up and telling myself \u201cShe\u2019s the one and you\u2019ve known it all along.\u201d I don\u2019t mean to steal your thunder or throw a pity party for myself, OP just reminded me of this and I thought I\u2019d share.",

I have found it really useful, not just in romantic relationships but also in other important relationships. It makes it easier to understand what others are trying to communicate, and also the best way to reciprocate. (Ex. Gifts are not at all how i show love and always found gifts to be a strange thing, but reading about how for some people that is their way of showing love helped me understand my friend that always buys people little gifts, and made me more contientious of buying her gifts).",

While waiting we were bantering back and forth with some light hearted jesting, and the people in the lines didn't seem to mind. I said something, though I don't remember what, and she had a quick retort about how she would be finished long before me. Several people in both lines awaited my response.

For example, I know a messy kitchen, particularly when she's the one cooking, is something that she hates. So, instead of sitting down and watching my football game when I get home (which she's totally fine with), I'll take 10-15 minutes to do any dishes, put away clean ones in the dishwasher, makes sure the counter is wiped down and cleared off. It's a little thing that makes her less stressed. And I like it when she acknowledges she notices. \n\nAnother big one is communication. If either of us is grumpy, or overly tired, for some reason people try to hide it, or deny it. We verbalize it before hand to give the other that knowledge, so if one of us is a little less chipper, or a little bit snippy, we know. And we've both become really good at apologizing quickly, and have really removed the stigma of being wrong. \n\nLastly, remembering not to let the routine take away the tiny stuff like holding hands when we watch TV, or I used to *think* \"she looks pretty today\", but I didn't say it. When we went to couples counseling years back, something she said was that she didn't feel like I thought she was pretty, and I was like \"You're crazy! I think you're very pretty, and I notice it all the time!\" \nThe counselor was like \"when is the last time youve said so?\" I was like...\"Well remember that one time...at that plac-...oh...\"\n\nJust little things like that.",

But it\u2019s those small sacrifices you make, and taking the time to do it. \n\nAlso I feel establishing your respective \u2018love language\u2019 is important, as you might not show love outwardly in the same ways. One of you might be a gift giver, whereas the other one might just get really cuddly and verbalise their love, and if you\u2019re both expecting the same thing you\u2019re giving out in return then one or both of you will end up disappointed in the long term if there\u2019s no communication about these things. \n\nAlso I feel sex compatibility and the ability to talk about sex openly is paramount to a healthy relationship. If your partner wants sex 5-6 times a week, every week and you\u2019re not up to it? That\u2019s going to cause some friction unless you two can talk about it and both make compromises.

We all KNOW that, but hearing HOW someone else does it, with little actions, helps us to pinpoint things in our own relationships. \n\n\nI know it\u2019s anecdotal and it\u2019s v different for everyone, but even your piece about knowing that she hates to see dishes in the kitchen when she\u2019s about to cook - that made me think about the things that my partner doesn\u2019t like and what I do to make sure that those annoying things are taken away before it gets to that point. \n\nMy partner and I had a rocky start because we both wanted different things. We met abroad and then both went back to our respective countries and I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d make it.\n\nBut that time back home allowed me to ground myself again - I know the things I love - exercising, yoga, dance, reading, visiting cafes, keeping a grateful journal, eating well, and I was able to do more of those things again. That made me happier and more secure and in turn, he gravitated towards that. \n\nSo when people say \u201cyou need to love yourself and work on yourself for your partner to love you\u201d, I 100% believe that and those are the things I do to make sure  that I\u2019m happy. On my own. Outside of the relationship. \n\nI just wish that when people gave advice based on their experiences, that they actually spoke about their actions. It\u2019s just not possible to wake up one day and suddenly realise that you and your partner are older and you\u2019ve both changed. \n\nWhat did you do to get that point?\nRead books? Which ones?\nWrite things down somewhere?\nTime apart?\nWeekends away together?\nDate nights?\nCounseling?\nFun relationship quizzes?\n\nAnyways, thanks so much for your comment. It\u2019s great reading stories like that.",

This was before the CD era when vinyl was king.\n\n I bought thousands of CDs, starting when they first started to trickle into the market. My first player, a Sony Discman, cost what felt like a fortune!\n\nBut I never stopped buying vinyl, even when it was hard to even find records. I've been enjoying the vinyl resurgence so much. Now I'm back to buying new releases from my favorite bands on wax and have a new U-Turn Orbit to enjoy them on.\n\nOn top of that I've seen thousands of shows over the past 40 years.

Some slavic music similarly as well, but much more recent. \nI've always been into what I like to call \"cultural music\" of any country, people, ethnicity and all but managed to find few so far. Wish there was one for each cause it's a delight to my ears. I feel as if I was listening to culture if it makes any sense. \nGuess I came into it as some sort of rabbit hole on YouTube looking for medieval music of specific regions, so it is safe to assume I am into medieval ballads as well, listen to Roman songs \"Synaulia\" and much like described on the first paragraph \"greek sounding music\" too.\nSo, now to the more common genres: I love classical music and opera, grew up to it cause I used to dance ballet when I was young, so it kinda stuck.\nMy father listened to rock, he was born on the 60s and after going through my Backstreet Boys years as a good 90s girl, I started to listen to metal and that's what I mostly listen to to this day and I'm 31 now. I consider metal and classical music kind of kids of the same parents but a little bit different, to me it seems like a natural progression that I got into rock and metal liking Bach, Mozart and all those dudes because of how similar certain subgenres of metal sound to me to classical music. \nI am no musician by any means (meaning that I am unsure if classical music and metal/rock are musically similar), both genres just make me feel in a similar way. The \"power\" of certain songs and all, that's what I mean.\nSo, I'm into Black Metal, Folk, Progressive, Symphonic, Power, Symphonic-Power, Symphonic-Black, (yeah, all that good stuff), Doom, guess I kinda like some melodic metal too and melodic-power, some Death, some Heavy...\n\nIt's easier if I say what I don't like very much: grunge, punk, trash metal, deathcore, nu metal and it's a 50/50 with hard rock. \n\nMy favorite bands are Haggard, Blind Guardian, Savatage, Royal Hunt, Burzum, Cradle of Filth, Ayreon, Rhapsody (old), and Pathfinder (Poland) brings shivers down my spine.\n\nEdit: Ah, I don't own any CD nor anything anymore, it kinda got lost through time and I moved a few times, so everything I have now is digital and that's the format I consume my music. Don't even own a music player anymore unfortunately.",

For hip hop, my little group of friends do Gin and Juice.

Kids are playing outside, riding bikes, shooting hoops. Just having fun. I don't have kids, but if I did, I wouldn't mind them growing up around here.\n\nQuick comment about music. Sure I think \"pop\" music is in the toilet, but depending on what you listen to, there's still a lot of great music. Bands I loved from the 80s and bands like them are still putting out awesome music. Old Metal with Antrhax and Megadeth to name a couple. New metal with Gojira and Mastodon to name a couple.\n\nAlso plenty of other new and great music out there. But then, that's the great thing about music and the day and age with live in. Even if I hated all new music, thanks to the internet, I can listen to all sorts of 70s and 80s music. From what I grew up with to what I've never heard before (thanks to My Analog Journal on YouTube)  \n\nedit - Just wanted to add not watching the news and staying off of social media helps.",
