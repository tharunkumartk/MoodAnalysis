He offered to PM me and abused that. He first emotionally distanced me from my friends in the real world so I only relied on him for support. This is how he was able to make me codependent on him and would put up with other things so he could get what he wanted. \n\nHe convinced me I had a serious mental illness so I questioned my sanity so when he made stepped over a boundary I was just being \u201ccrazy\u201d. He worked for the NCA. He told me he could \u201cfind me easily\u201d. He got my personal details. I was terrified one day he would turn up at my house. \n\nA couple of other things happened, I eventually went to his work and had to give a statement. I\u2019m pretty sure he lost his job for talking to me at work and abusing his power to manipulate a mentally ill teenager. I had to sit in a room with a bunch of two way mirrors and hidden cameras and talk about everything. They screened my laptop. I don\u2019t know if my video was used in court I kind of left it all behind after that. \n\nBut anyway. All this came from one PM. You should never trust a random stranger not everyone is just looking out for you and wants to talk.",

It's complicated cause he has personality issues too.\n\nOne of the most difficult training issues at my agency is helping new responders set boundaries with people in crisis.  But it's absolutely necessary - maybe more necessary than with people *not* in crisis.  We harm people by *not* disrupting their unrealistic expectations that can never be met.  We also harm people when we try to give them what we simply haven't got.  So sometimes the best harm-reduction option is to say directly \"I'm really sorry, but I can't give you what you're asking me for\".   It can help to offer alternatives when we say that, even if they reject them in the moment.",

So, again, all that's outside our mission and should be discouraged. \n\nSort by new, look for people in distress who haven't received quality replies and empathise with them.  \n\nNice jaunty bow you have on your tail there :-)",

Sometimes everything's wet in here from humidity alone. \n\nWould've been just my day to call work and tell them that 200 precious, unique pictures are lost because sadly I still live at home and don't have a safe room and anything I don't lock away gets destroyed.

I\u2019m exhausted all the time, and have no motivation left for anything. I\u2019ve been having a par toculatly hard time with my depression the last few months, and Then I got hit with some really crappy news this week.\n\nI live in a lot of physical pain, have for over a decade. I made my peace with that, it didn\u2019t contribute to my depression. But now, I have a new condition, that my doctor says will never go away, never get better, only grown worse. My insides hurt all the time. I\u2019d figured out how to live with my other chronic pain issues, but this is somehow so different.\nI just want one part of my body not to hurt. The diagnosis has crippled my already shockingly poor mental health, and I\u2019ve lost the will to live entirely. I can\u2019t do any of the things I enjoy, and I\u2019m now terrified my boyfriend will leave me, and he\u2019d have every right to do so. He didn\u2019t sign up for this. He wants kids, and I can\u2019t have them let alone raise them or mother then. I don\u2019t even know how to tell him yet. I just got the diagnosis this week. Why would he possibly want me once he knows? I know it\u2019s selfish, but I feel like I need time to process my grief myself before I speak to him, tell him our entire life plan is out the window, and I\u2019m no longer what he wanted.\nHell, I probably won\u2019t even be able to have sex soon. I\u2019m getting more depressed and harder to be around. I feel like no matter how hard I try, I\u2019m a colder, crueller person. I rarely make jokes anymore. I miss who I used to be. I feel like I\u2019m grieving for my own death.\n\nI get criticized for keeping my thoughts and feelings to myself, and not opening up or sharing and when I do, I can\u2019t actually talk to anyone about it, because they either worry over something they can\u2019t fix, or tell me that my life is too sad or too depressing or they \u2018can\u2019t handle it\u2019.\n\nOne of my good friends committed suicide a while ago. I miss her, and a lot of things are reminding me of her lately. I hope her pain is gone now. I know it\u2019s selfish, but I wish she was still here. She was one of the best people I\u2019ve ever known.\n\nI have a dog who I could not live without, and I worry that when she\u2019s gone, I\u2019ll lose my last reason to stay here. She got me through my worst months of depression, my suicidal thoughts a few years ago, and she continues to get me through the worst days. I just want something. To get better. Anything really.\n\n\nI appreciate having this space to vent about bad days, months, years. To vent About depression to people who understand what it\u2019s like. To rant about how crippling depression itself can be, and how much harder it makes a bad day.  I hope all of you find some peace, relief, or joy in something. I hope your pain eases soon, and that you have better days ahead of you.",

This can be like an invitation for others to write their suicide note.\n\nMost people who post about even immediate-sounding intent don't go on to die by suicide - often it's the only way they feel able to reach out for support when they're in crisis. Seeing that other struggle with suicidal thoughts isn't, in and of itself, a factor for suicide risk - in fact, feeling less alone with suicidality can decrease a sense of alienation, which is one of the major risk factors for suicidality. \n\nWhile SW is the better place for posting suicidal thoughts/intent specifically, how people express their struggles is not as much a concern to us as how commenters respond - we encourage people to write thoughtful, individualized responses, and avoid responses that aren't responsive to the OP's experience and needs, general uplifting messages, prescribing and incitement (rules 2, 4-8), as all of those are things that *are* known to increase risk and generally make people feel worse. \n\nIf you see any content of that nature on *any* post here, whether it mentions suicidality or not, please do report it so we can deal.",

However, it doesn't have to last forever. Things like drinking will limit you on getting out of the depression. Try going to a therapist if you aren't already and get a routine to get energy flowing again. Play guitar, or go outside or anything, but set the bar low for yourself. It isn't about how well you do those things but see the fact that you did it as a victory in itself. Same for being social with other people and work, it doesn't have to go well. It never goes well all the time, but by continuing and putting in effort things might get easier again eventually. \n\nAlso just breaking down and being lethargic is okay as well.

You will need to divert your mind from negative thoughts & start doing something that gives meaning to your own life. You will be surprised to know that I feel the opposite of what you do & you should feel heartening after listening to my life case. For a period of 50 years I felt worthless because my father told me what works for men in my bloodline at the age of 15 with a promise that I will not do what he had asked me to do till my 45th birthday or beyond. i kept my promise. I started using what worked for men in my bloodline at the age of 45 years & 6 months.  We call it work, with give & take. I did it for a long period. It was somewhere in the June of 2020 that all the people who were cause of my suffering started meeting their chosen fate. My problems started disappearing. I am unemployed since March 2020 but am feeling relieved that I listened to my father & chose to fail instead of jump the gun & become outright wrong if I chased success at that point. I knew what work, give & take in my bloodline was but the right time was chosen by my father which was after 45 years of age. All I had to do was take the beating letting our enemies live in a delusion that I did not know what to do. Even when I am unemployed I have touched all the bases & am free. It is not that I am imagining it but know that great times lie ahead.  My father had clearly told me that if I jump the gun it would mean I do not have the three rights needed for success (doing the right thing, the right way at the right time) will not be present & will make me wrong. Today the spring in my feet is very different from what it was till June of 2020 when i turned close to 50 years of age after having done what my father had told me to do after 45 years of age. I do not know whether you have legacy in your bloodline like I have in mine. Jumping the gun is a main reason people suffer. Secondly if the wrong influence in your bloodline has not been shown where they stand they only destroy your life. Of course the  wrong influence can only disappear if you know what to write & to whom. If all this sounds familiar to you you better do it. If it is not then you have a different path which must have been told to you by your father if you are are a son  from  a patriarchal family or by your mother if you are a daughter from a matriarchal family.  It is all about clearing the mess of your earlier life at this point or else the wrong influence will be around to destroy your next life. I hope you find a solution after reading my comment.",

I'm paraphrasing - 'at the beginning it's the end of the world, because it literally is. the person you've lost was your whole life. Most of your experiences were in relation to that person. In order to get a little release from the grief, one should not try to hide it or make it smaller. Instead it should grow around it. Live with it. It does not get easier.. Grief does not get smaller.. It's still here, same as the first day you experienced it.. It just becomes a smaller part of your life as time goes on..'\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's a similar illustration, but I like to think of the circles getting bigger, and the grief staying the same size: [https://aftertheheartbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/My-Stages-of-Grief.jpg](https://aftertheheartbreak.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/My-Stages-of-Grief.jpg)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if grief is what you're experiencing, as this is a depression sub, but nevertheless I wish you all the best..\n\nListen to music - it can be a lifesaver.

I'm a whole marathon ahead of my peers but my parents still don't think its enough, and they fail to realize that all of this has an impact on my mental health. They expect more than I can do and then when I can't they always mouth off on how that's my only responsibility (which it isn't). And my dad loves getting between me and my gf. I'm actually going to break up with her soon. Above I said that I was only alive for my grandma and cat, but she's the third reason. The breakup is only gonna make things worse for me but I know she'll end up being happier from it, rather than this sinking ship of a relationship that my dad caused. On top of that he is mentally and verbally abusive and very aggressive and explosive. It's just a living hell I wouldn't wish on anyone, and most of the time I just get by on a fake smile and bottling my emotions while I lay in bed wishing that I could just kill myself without leaving my entire family feeling empty and hurt. I bare this pain so that others don't and that's just my personality, I'm a selfless person. And that's mainly because I don't care about myself.\n\nOkie that was quite the ramble hehe.
