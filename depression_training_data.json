He was in great shape prior to covid, he was driving daily still at 88 and cooking pancakes for my cousin(he lived with my aunt). Sadly he caught covid and survived until a few months later he lost all ability to walk and needed a walker and wheelchair, he then developed dementia months after and took a awful turn the end of this year, not remembering me or anyone else, eating napkins and falling almost every day and my cousins or aunt would have to pick him up. I spent days out there with him taking off from work to help out but I feel I didnt do enough. I am 31 and know i should be thankful i had him for this long, but it hurts like hell. I was very close with him, the oldest grandson by 5 years and we had a special connection, he understood who i was. He met my fiance and was very happy for us. But I have been very depressed this last week. I was looking forward to spending this one last thanksgiving with him. He was a good man, only 5'4 to my 6'1 but i looked up to him and respected him more than anybody and id do anything to make him live a little longer, he was a korean war vet and did anything for his grandkids...I was closer with him than my own father. Its a difficult loss for me , even if he was almost 90. I am really going to miss him and talking to him, learning from him.",

There was also a point in my life where I was able to deal with a stressful reality crushing my spirit through psychedelic use, but the utility they've had for me has run out, and they were starting to exacerbate my mental issues, so I haven't used them for years.\n\nRegardless of all this, I feel like I'm just stuck with depression forever, to the point where I'll be honest, being depressed feels like my normal state, and the fleeting moments of happiness an increasingly rarer gift. Buddhism and Daoism are basically the only spiritual guidance/philosophies that have really helped me hang on, since they accept the premise that life is suffering, and that there is some sort of transcendent \"duty\" we perform in our lifetimes, but it's hard for me to not be resentful of my existence.\n\nWhoever says it gets better is a fucking liar, but whoever says it makes a little bit more sense day by day gets it. By \"makes sense\" I mean that you're aware of the depression, but you still have to deal with the emotional burdens even if it \"makes sense\". Well, I'm tired of dealing with it, and I don't want MAOIs, SSRIs or whatever to cope. The world is awful and stripped of wonder, and I'm tired of pretending its not.

They never do, and God is bullshit. What kind of 'God' destroys families by letting children die. Forcing parents to bury their kid at 19. And don't tell me any religious bullshit. The fact that there are multiple religions on this planet just means that something isn't right. I mean, if there really was a God, why do so many people worship a different version of him. How do some people live believing in Jesus while others don't? Who can support either POV? Fuck this. Bullshit. I've been left in the fucking dark for so long like so many of you.

I have spent the last 6 months in a bad depression, and today I\u2019m having the first signs of it perhaps lifting. \n\nI notice that right now, my memory recall is much better than it was during this whole period. I am able to problem solve and think things through much better today. But for the past half a year I have been convinced that my brain was utterly broken. \n\nVERY sluggish thinking, lack of ideas, lack of critical thinking, lack of basically any thinking that wasn\u2019t pointless rumination over little things I said and did that I regret.  Forgetting information as soon as it\u2019s told to me, not being able to follow even the simplest storylines in shows and movies\u2026 Inability to reflect on anything with any sort of depth or creativity. And perhaps most disturbingly: unable to access pretty much any memories of my life, save for a brief \u201cblip\u201d, bits and pieces of memory that are too vague to be meaningful or useful.\n\nBasically, my activities for the past 6 months have been extremely limited due to an inability to THINK. Every second it seems, I lose focus and slip into mindless rumination. Like I\u2019m being completely overwhelmed by automatic negative thoughts, to the point where it\u2019s literally not possible for me to engage with the outside world in any meaningful way. \n\nNow, I know rumination is typical of depression. But from what I understand, many people with depression retain their memories and much of their cognitive abilities despite the mood disorder. Does anyone else have such an extreme cognitive \u201cswitch\u201d during depression, to the point where they feel totally and completely impaired like this? \n\nMy brother also struggles sometimes with depression, but he\u2019s still able to engage in activities that require some higher order thinking, such as playing video games. Every time I\u2019ve tried to play video games during my episode I\u2019ve given up because trying to remember the controls and objectives is just way too stressful.",

    "text": "I don't know about you guys but for as long as I can remember now I've been feeling out of myself. What I mean by that is; is that I use to look at the world as an individual. Anything's possible, everything's in reach.\n\nNowadays I look at the world very dissociatedly , everything feels daunting, uncertain, science seems uncertain, sure it's based on fact but there's too much we don't know about things. I'm amazed about how populated this planet is, and how many men and women they're are. None of us truly unique, unless in ways you define it. I kind of look at us like walking penis's and vagina's, we all create life in the same way. To reinforce this idea, I kind of view life in more of a primal sense. We do the things we do based on primal needs, I missed when I didn't think that way.\n\nI'm trying to depict this headspace as accurately as I can. I miss the days where I didn't feel this way, where everything was because it was. I didn't think about these things, I didn't obsess over my future. I just assumed that I was gifted in one space, and everything would work itself out. Now I feel as if I'm wasting my time everyday, and have a insane drive to make something of myself, but no idea where to start.\n\nConstantly pacing in my bedroom, having an idea of the life I want to live, but no blueprint in order to get there. It's insanely frustrating, and anxiety inducing, can anyone relate?\n\nThanks for reading this clusterfuck of an idea.",
